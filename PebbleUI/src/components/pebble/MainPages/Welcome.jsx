      <h2>Your Personalised Study Management App !</h2>

      <p>
        It helps you stay consistent with learning by focusing on small,
        daily efforts instead of overwhelming goals.

      <h2>What is Pebble?</h2>

      <p>
        Pebble is built around the idea that meaningful progress comes from small actions done regularly. A <strong>Project</strong> represents a long-term learning goal. Each project is broken into topics, and every study session is recorded as a <strong>Pebble</strong>.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2>Why use Pebble?</h2>

      <p>
        Most people fail to learn new skills not because they lack ability, but because they struggle with consistency. Pebble encourages you to show up every day, track the time you spend learning, and build momentum gradually.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2>How does Pebble work?</h2>

      <p>
        You begin by creating a project for a learning goal you want to achieve. Each time you study, you add a Pebble and record what you worked on and how much time you spent. Over time, these small study sessions accumulate into visible and measurable progress.
